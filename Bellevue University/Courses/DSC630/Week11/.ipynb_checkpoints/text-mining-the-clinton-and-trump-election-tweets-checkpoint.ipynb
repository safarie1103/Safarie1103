    "\n",
    "This is my first kernel on text mining. I wanted to mine 'real' social media data, and chose the dataset that contains all Tweets in which Hillary Clinton and/or Donald Trump were involved during the 2016 US presidential election campaigns. After a brief overall data exploration , I quickly moved on to mining the Tweet texts themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some initial text cleaning with `dplyr`, I created vcorpus objects with the `tm` package and used cleaning functions from this package to further clean the text (such as removing stopwords). Using a TermsFrequencyMatrix, I created plots of the most used words by both Clinton and Trump, and also added `wordclouds` for both candidates. Besides basic wordclouds of most used words, I also added a `comparison cloud` which plots the difference in word usage by both candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I also wanted to see what the `tidytext` package (part of tidyverse) has to offer with regards to text mining, I converted the corpus objects into tidy dataframes. Using tidytext, I created bigrams (most used 2-words combinations) for both candidates, and also did sentiment analysis using 3 different lexicons. Using the `bing` lexicon, I created plots of the most used positive and negative words. In addition, I did a time series sentiment analysis based on both the `bing` and `AFINN` lexicons. Furthermore, I used the `nrc` lexicon to also see what (basic) emotions were used the most.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Twitter has played an increasingly prominent role in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Debates have raged and candidates have risen and fallen based on tweets. This dataset provides ~3000 recent tweets from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the two major-party presidential nominees.\n",
